We investigate the use of deep convolutional network for modeling the complex scene label structures, relying on a supervised greedy learning strategy. Com- pared to standard approaches based on CRFs, our strategy does not need hand-crafted fea- tures, allows modeling more complex spatial dependencies and has a lower inference cost. Experiments over the MSRC benchmark and the LabelMe dataset show the effectiveness of our approach.},
